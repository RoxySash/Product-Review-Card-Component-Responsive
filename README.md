## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned that using the max-width for the vh to be 100% is crucial in making the site responsive. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
:root {
    --Darkcyan: hsl(158, 36%, 37%);
    --Cream: hsl(30, 38%, 92%);
    --Verydarkblue: hsl(212, 21%, 14%);
    --grayishblue: hsl(228, 12%, 48%);
    --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
}
```

### Continued development

I am getting better at making site responsive. 

### Useful resources

-(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-transform) - This helped me for to capitalize the p element. I will use it going forward.
